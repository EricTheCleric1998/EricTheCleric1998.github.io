The Whole Brain
I have always liked writing, especially for my new video game idea called “The Chosen” which focuses on a paladin trying to bring back the grace of their goddess to the world. It has been a challenge for me, especially because I have had to use both sides of my brain in even conceptual thinking. What game mechanics do I want, and what kind of story will I want to tell? Do I need an open world for this video game, or can it be a linear story? These are questions I must ask myself during the creative process. Personally, the amount of brain usage I have when thinking about this project can wear me out quite quickly, but I have slowly been able to organize my creative thoughts into something logical and reasonable. I also can’t decide if I want to make this a video game or a book, so…

Golden Circle
1.	Why: To develop and design video games that people will enjoy for years
2.	How: Deep Dive Digital Media bootcamp

Elevator Pitch
Version 1
Hello, my name is Eric Hillmeyer. I am currently attending the Deep Dive Digital Media bootcamp to increase my skills regarding digital media, especially video game design and development. I plan to use the skills I attain in the bootcamp to make myself employable in the field of video game design and development. Are you in the video game business?




Weekly Reflections
Week 1
Over the course of the week we did plenty of activities including, but not limited to, game design, augmented reality (AR), video recording, and the importance of documenting projects. I found these activities to be very engaging, and I appreciated the hands-on, yet laid back studio-like atmosphere the bootcamp sets. However, I floundered in finding activities to engage in occasionally during class. This was due in part to the laid back environment, but it was mostly due to my personal handicaps when it comes to this atmosphere. These types of atmospheres help me focus as they are normally quiet and comfy, but my mind veers. I will need to work on that moving forward so I can both remain comfortable but also productive.
