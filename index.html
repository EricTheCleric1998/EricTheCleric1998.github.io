<h3>The Whole Brain</h3>
    <p>I have always liked writing, especially for my new video game idea called “The Chosen” which focuses on a paladin trying to bring back the grace of their goddess to the world. It has been a challenge for me, especially because I have had to use both sides of my brain in even conceptual thinking. What game mechanics do I want, and what kind of story will I want to tell? Do I need an open world for this video game, or can it be a linear story? These are questions I must ask myself during the creative process. Personally, the amount of brain usage I have when thinking about this project can wear me out quite quickly, but I have slowly been able to organize my creative thoughts into something logical and reasonable. I also can’t decide if I want to make this a video game or a book, so…</p>
  
<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
    <p>1.	Why: To develop and design video games that people will enjoy for years</p>
    <p>2.	How: Deep Dive Digital Media bootcamp</p>
    <p>3.	What: Video game development and other forms of digital media</p>
  
<h3>Elevator Pitch:</h3>
    <p>Hello, my name is Eric Hillmeyer. I am currently attending the Deep Dive Digital Media bootcamp to increase my skills regarding digital media, especially video game design and development. I plan to use the skills I attain in the bootcamp to make myself employable in the field of video game design and development. Are you in the video game business?</p>

<h3>Visuals Speak</h3>
    <a img src="Visuals Speak Photo.jpg" width="400" height="790" /a>

    <p> Bridging the gap between these two photos will be a challenge for me and maybe even those around me supporting my in my endeavors. Currently, I feel chained, held in place by my own youth and/or skills, which is represented by the first photo. I wish to achieve nirvana, as noted by the second picture, through the successful completion of Deep Dive and later by starting a successful career. My current life is not one I wish to have in one year. My idea of nirvana currently is attainable, but it will take work to get to that place.</p>

<h3>Organizations</h3>
<h4>Nonprofit</h4>
      <p>The nonprofit I chose was the New Mexico Fractal Foundation. I find these interesting as I have looked at the work they do and have always been fascinated in fractals since I was introduced to them nearly 10 years ago.</p>
      <p>Online Presence: The Fractal Foundation has a very good online presence. They have a Facebook and a well functioning, easy to use website. However, fractals are colorful and fascinating. The website does not reflect that as it is mostly white on beige, with the colors coming only from pictures of fractals people have done.</p>
      
<h4>For Profit</h4>
      <p>The for profit organization I chose was Active Imagination. They have been a part of my life since I learned how to play Magic: The Gathering and I love going to the store to buy cards.</p>
      <p>Online Presence: Active Imagination relies solely on Facebook for information to get out about events. They have told me as such. The Facebook page looks and functions exquisitely. Sadly, they don't get out as much information as they would like because of this. Fewer and fewer people are using Facebook these days, and they may want to put up a webpage soon. Maybe I should talk to them about that...</p>
      
<h3>Salary Expectations</h3>
      <p>To look up expected salaries, I used the Occupational Outlook Handbook. For a digital media specialist, the median expected salary nationwide was around $70,000. The entry salary was around $40,000 anually nationwide, so I expect to earn as much in my first few years of work. Realistically, it will be best to work in New Mexico for the first few years, as $40,000/year is not a good paycheck in places like Silicon Valley.</p>

<h3>Game Reflection</h3>
      <p>I want to say I work well on a team. Sadly, that is not as much of the case as I would like. I am good at using what I have mostly, but keeping my team together is not a strength. I am "too focused on my own board" so to speak. I have seen this issue in my time playing Magic: the Gathering. This hinders both my ability to compete, but also my ability to work on a team. I need to be more up front about the issues I see on my team, but also giving ideas on what we can all do to accomplish great things. I also noticed that I floundered when I didn't at least know all of the rules that made up the game. Ryan read them out, but I don't do well just hearing rules. Sergio and Anthony also seemed to not know but none of us spoke up about the issue. In the future I must communicate that rather than diving into the issue before we have a grasp of the issue and ways to solve it.</p>
      
<h3>Weekly Reflections</h3>
<h4> Week 1:</h4>
<p>Over the course of the week we did plenty of activities including, but not limited to, game design, augmented reality (AR), video recording, and the importance of documenting projects. I found these activities to be very engaging, and I appreciated the hands-on, yet laid back studio-like atmosphere the bootcamp sets. However, I floundered in finding activities to engage in occasionally during class. This was due in part to the laid back environment, but it was mostly due to my personal handicaps when it comes to this atmosphere. These types of atmospheres help me focus as they are normally quiet and comfy, but my mind veers. I will need to work on that moving forward so I can both remain comfortable but also productive.</p>
      
<h4>Week 2:</h4>
<p> Week 2 was more challenging by far than week 1 was. This was partially due to the hiccups we had at the beginning of the week, though mostly my own understanding of the content we were supposed to go over. We started using the Unity game development engine and a program named Vyond, but as it turns out one is much easier to understand than the other. I chose Unity as my program to use, but found out soon thereafter I regretted that decision. Over the course of probably 5 days, I looked up more and more tutorials for the program, but could not produce anything of substance. This is a learning experience for me for sure, one which shows me I need to get better at my learning on my own. Would I take this week back, though, even if it was "bad?" No, I needed a week like this to get my butt into gear. </p>

<h4>Week 3:</h4>
<p> Week 3 was much easier than week 2. We delved deeper into both Unity and Vyond, which proved useful to those struggling in both. Personally, the extra time I had working with Unity allowed me to move on with my project and work out issues that came up Three weeks in and I am already determined to finish this bootcamp. We go on trips, do real projects for others, and keep learning on a regular basis. The Digital Media bootcamp, to the best of my knowledge, feels like a nice, productive-yet-laid-back studio that I would expect. Rod and Britney are useful resources, but I have found that my fellow coworkers are just as amazing and helpful. I truly love working with and building my relationship with the others here. Only three weeks in and I would definitely recommend this and other bootcamps to prospective students.</p>

<h4>Week 4:</h4>
<p>This week we began working on Animate Creative Cloud (Animate CC). This program is just like the Unnity engine of the animation world, but was much easier to learn than Unity was. Personally, I began creating a little animation that was supposed to be ten seconds long but could not figure out how to make the image not go wonky. I eventually gave up and have begun a new project. I have been watching a lot of YouTube tutorials to hopefully make my project work this time around. We really got going this week on a podcast project we started in week 1 this week as well. At first the podcast was somewhat slow to pick up, but we were able to record audio and work on some storyboarding. This week was both productive and useful in my opinion, and the projects I'm working on now I will be happy to put into a portfolio later!</p>
      
<h4>Week 5:</h4>
<p>We continued working on Animate CC this week. This time I created an ooze that was sliming around a cave that ate and dissolved a box. The animation was easy enough to do, but some shapes went out of whack when I painted new shapes onto existing shapes that caused issues with how the program rendered the animation. I fixed this, and the animation turned out fine. We also worked as a team more on the podcast for our friend Alonso (the one who asked us to help with the podcast in the first place). Ryan Becker and I were able to go out to lunch with Alonso, and the team got together to discuss what was brought up at the lunch and think of ways to improve on the story we want to tell. This simple lunch has moved things along nicely, which is something I should keep in mind as I move forward in my career and need to begin working on other projects for other clients. We are supposed to have a draft for episode one of the podcast on Thursday of next week, but I am confident that we can make sure that happens.</p>
      
<h4>Week 6:</h4>
<p>Week 6 was likely the most productive week thus far. We moved along nicely on the podcast after working hard for five weeks straight. The editing has come together smoothly and we are looking at hitting our deadline quite easily. I also thought more about my capstone and decided on what I wanted to do. I will combine all of the digital media skills I have learned to create what is (at least in my mind) an ambitious project. Animation, AR, 3D design, and 3D printing will be the center points of the project, and I am working to get it done by week 10. This deadline will set me up to have a 2 week "cushion" to finalize my project should anything go wrong. I am happy with how things are coming together in the bootcamp.</p>
      
<h4>Week 7:</h4>
<p>We continued working on the podcast again this week. We now have some hard deadlines for that, and the editors have been working hard to get their pieces done, and we will be splicing together the parts into a cohesive first episode by the middle of next week. We also went out to see How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World on Wednesday so we could get some insight into what professional animation and 3D modeling. The movie was enjoyable, but the parts that caught me the most were how they animated everything. These days things look just cartoonish enough to remind me of animations like Toy Story but just real enough to make me hold my suspension of disbelief that it's animated. The capstone project is coming together much better as well, and it looks like I can even have it done early the more I work on it. Lastly we took photos on Friday, and I am excited to see how mine came out. I'm excited for next week and getting to Demo Day where I can show off what I have been working on!</p>
