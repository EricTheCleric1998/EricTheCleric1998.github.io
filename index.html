<h3>The Whole Brain</h3>
<p>I have always liked writing, especially for my new video game idea called “The Chosen” which focuses on a paladin trying to bring back the grace of their goddess to the world. It has been a challenge for me, especially because I have had to use both sides of my brain in even conceptual thinking. What game mechanics do I want, and what kind of story will I want to tell? Do I need an open world for this video game, or can it be a linear story? These are questions I must ask myself during the creative process. Personally, the amount of brain usage I have when thinking about this project can wear me out quite quickly, but I have slowly been able to organize my creative thoughts into something logical and reasonable. I also can’t decide if I want to make this a video game or a book, so…</p>

<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
<p>1.	Why: To develop and design video games that people will enjoy for years</p>
<p>2.	How: Deep Dive Digital Media bootcamp</p>
<p>3.	What: Video game development and other forms of digital media</p>

<h3>Elevator Pitch:</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Eric Hillmeyer. I am currently attending the Deep Dive Digital Media bootcamp to increase my skills regarding digital media, especially video game design and development. I plan to use the skills I attain in the bootcamp to make myself employable in the field of video game design and development. Are you in the video game business?</p>

<h3>Visuals Speak</h3>

<p> Bridging the gap between these two photos will be a challenge for me and maybe even those around me supporting my in my endeavors. Currently, I feel chained, held in place by my own youth and/or skills, which is represented by the first photo. I wish to achieve nirvana, as noted by the second picture, through the successful completion of Deep Dive and later by starting a successful career. My current life is not one I wish to have in one year. My idea of nirvana currently is attainable, but it will take work to get to that place.</p>

<h3>Weekly Reflections</h3>
<h4> Week 1:</h4>
<p>Over the course of the week we did plenty of activities including, but not limited to, game design, augmented reality (AR), video recording, and the importance of documenting projects. I found these activities to be very engaging, and I appreciated the hands-on, yet laid back studio-like atmosphere the bootcamp sets. However, I floundered in finding activities to engage in occasionally during class. This was due in part to the laid back environment, but it was mostly due to my personal handicaps when it comes to this atmosphere. These types of atmospheres help me focus as they are normally quiet and comfy, but my mind veers. I will need to work on that moving forward so I can both remain comfortable but also productive.</p>

<h4>Week 2:</h4>
<p> Week 2 was more challenging by far than week 1 was. This was partially due to the hiccups we had at the beginning of the week, though mostly my own understanding of the content we were supposed to go over. We started using the Unity game development engine and a program named Vyond, but as it turns out one is much easier to understand than the other. I chose Unity as my program to use, but found out soon thereafter I regretted that decision. Over the course of probably 5 days, I looked up more and more tutorials for the program, but could not produce anything of substance. This is a learning experience for me for sure, one which shows me I need to get better at my learning on my own. Would I take this week back, though, even if it was "bad?" No, I needed a week like this to get my butt into gear. </p>

  <h4>Week 3:</h4>
  <p> Week 3 was much easier than week 2. We delved deeper into both Unity and Vyond, which proved useful to those struggling in both. Personally, the extra time I had working with Unity allowed me to move on with my project and work out issues that came up Three weeks in and I am already determined to finish this bootcamp. We go on trips, do real projects for others, and keep learning on a regular basis. Digital media, to the best of my knowledge, feels like a nice, productive-yet-laid-back studio that I would expect. Rod and Britney are useful resources, but I have found that my fellow coworkers are just as amazing and helpful. I truly love working with and building my relationship with the others here. Only three weeks in and I would definitely recommend this and other bootcamps to prospective students.</p>
